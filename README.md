# cmmm-plus-indev
This mod aims to recreate the cells from CMMM+ in Indev. It is still a work in progress and currently lacks the input cells, counter cell, and player and pacman characters. However, I have made sure that the cells function in the same way by referring to the source code and game. I plan to add these missing cells when possible, and I also have plans to include the physical generator and support for the mp1 format.

And the best part: fall cells can be rotated!
